# This role makes an assumption that the stateful client will
# be a client chosen from the regular nomad client pool. (Specifically, the first in the host list.)
# If you want to have a separate stateful client machine,
# then you'll need to update this role to perform other operations
# that the other nomad client role does, like copy over
# a Systemd service unit file, etc...
#
# An even robuster solution might involve having separate stateful
# clients for each stateful service you have. If you've got Redis,
# MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc... you might want separate machine[s] for each
# which you might want to provision uniquely with their own role.
